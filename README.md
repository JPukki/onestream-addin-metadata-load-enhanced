# Use case

- Load metadata .xmls to OneStream with replace mode (i.e. delete all relationships from dimensions before load)
- Create missing security groups automatically during load 
- Nest security groups to match entity hierarchy

# Install

- Load PackageContents.zip file to OneStream

# Uninstall

- Use either one of the uninstall buttons found on the setting page
 - Both work the same way since the solution doesn't create any tables; both buttons visible for compatibility with OpenPlace template
